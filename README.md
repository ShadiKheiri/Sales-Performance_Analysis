# Page 1 – Performance Overview
This page analyzes overall business performance from 2014 to 2017 using quarterly sales, profit, and margin trends.

## Key Insights
- Sales increased steadily from 2014 to 2017, indicating consistent business growth.
- Profit was highest in Q4 2016 and early 2017, showing strong performance at the end of the year.
- In some quarters, sales were high but profit margins were lower. This means higher sales did not always lead to better efficiency.
- Lower margins during high-sales periods may be caused by heavy discounts or higher costs.
- Sales often increase in Q4, which suggests the business is affected by seasonal trends.

## Business Interpretation
Revenue growth remains strong; however, profitability requires continuous monitoring due to margin sensitivity and discount fluctuations.

# Page 2 – Regional Profitability Analysis
This page evaluates profitability performance across regions by comparing total profit and profit margin.

## Key Insights
- The West region makes the most profit and has the highest margin, which shows it is both large and efficient.
- The East region performs steadily and keeps a fairly stable margin, showing balanced results.
- The Central region has lower margins, which may indicate pricing or cost structure challenges.
  
## Business Interpretation
Differences between regions show that the company should focus on improving profit margins, especially in the regions that are not performing well.

# Page 3 – Product & Sub-Category Profitability
This page evaluates profit distribution across product sub-categories to identify performance concentration and loss-making segments.

## Key Insights
- Copiers and Phones make the most profit and are very important for the Technology category.
- Tables and Bookcases are losing money and reduce overall profit.
- Some sub-categories have high sales but low profit, which means they are not very efficient.

## Business Interpretation
Most of the profit comes from a few strong product groups. Products that are losing money should be reviewed (To improve overall profit in the long term, either their prices need to change or costs need to be reduced).

# Page 4 - Discount rate analysis
This page looks at the average discount for each product sub-category to understand pricing strategy differences and their impact on profitability.

## Key Insights
- Binders have the highest average discount rate, well above the overall average discount of 15.62%.
- Sub-categories like Labels, Storage, and Art have low discount levels, showing more stable pricing.
- Discount rates are not consistent across products, meaning some categories receive much heavier promotions than others.

## Business Interpretation
High discounts in certain product groups may be reducing profit margins. The company should review its pricing and promotion strategy in these high discount categories to make sure sales growth is not hurting long term profitability.

# Final Business Conclusion
- The analysis shows steady sales growth and clear seasonal trends. However, profit is affected by discounts and some products that are not efficient.
- Strategic focus on margin optimization across regions, product categories, and pricing strategy can significantly improve overall financial performance and long-term sustainability.
